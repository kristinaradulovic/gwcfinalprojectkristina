  <h1> <center> About Us </center> </h1>
  <center>
    <p>The teaching team placed the four of us in the same group because of our desire to provide service to our communities. After hours of discussion and bouncing ideas off of one another, we hit our first wall. It seemed neraly impossible to condense our broad range of interests into one project. However, not long after, we agreed to focus on developing a method to combat Gerrymandering thanks to John Oliver's video on Youtube. We were all excited to start working because it was a a relevant topic that also satisfied all of our interests.</p>

  <h1> <center> About Gerrymandering </center> </h1>
  <center>
  <h2><p><strong>What is it?</strong></p></h2>
  <div>Gerrymandering is a political practice of politicians who redraw district lines with the purpose of provideing their party with an advantadge. A prime example is the derivation of the name from when Governor Elbridge Garry of Michigan drew his districts so distinctly that it resembled a dragon. This was and still is an issue because it leads to the misrepresentation of the popular vote and provides an unfair advantadge for one party.</div>
  <h2><p><strong>Our Mission</h2></p></strong>
  <div>Our mission is to spread the message and provide a way for people to visualize how this affects them. As well as provide a way for people to combat the issue at hand.</div>
  <h2><p><strong>Gerrymandering and Gentrification</strong></p></h2>
  <div>The underlining issue of gentrification is that it silences minorities whether it be political or racial minorities. Gerrymandering has been around for as long as politics has been prevalent in the United States, but it was officially coined in 1882. Genetrification is the cultural version of gerrymandering. Where racial minorities are driven out when the community is renovated and prices skyrocket to a point where they have no other choice but to move out. Politically both processes lead to the same outcomes. </div>

<div class="explanation"> <strong> <h2> Explanation </h2> </strong> As shown in the image and data above, there is discrepancy between the popular vote and district vote for this specific election (specifically focusing on Democrat and Republican parties). Democrats outweigh Republicans by almost 5% in the popular vote. However, Districts 1 and 8 are more Republican than Democrat, and Districts 7 and 9 are more Democrat than Republican. If the other parties were neglected, this would have put Democrats at an unfair disadvantage in the district vote.</div>

  <div id="HowItWorks">
  <h1> <center> How it Works </center> </h1>
  <center>
    <h2><p><strong> API </h2></p></strong>
    <div> To collect the data shown in the example above, we downloaded the "2016 King County election results by precinct" API and filtered the data to one specific election. Then, we manually calculated the vote percentages by party.</div>
    <h2><p><strong>Our Fairness Policy</h2></p></strong>
    <div>The original idea for our project involved redistricting a previously gerrymandered area to make the districts more "fair." We defined this by equating the results of the popular vote to the actual results by as much as possible. Unfortunately, we had limited time and resources, so we could not complete this extension.</div>
    <h2><p><strong> Future Applications</h2></p></strong>
    <div> Our project is currently at a preliminary stage, serving as an informative website where people can learn about the current political climate in America. The API we used allowed us to view in-depth data, down to each individual vote. We soon realized that physically manipulating the boundaries was more time-consuming and difficult than it seemed. However, this is not to say that redistricting according to our fairness policy is not feasible. With more time and more data, it is possible. However, we must start by educating the public about gerrymandering, which we hope to accomplish through our website. </div>
